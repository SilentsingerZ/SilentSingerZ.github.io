			<h1>Why rabbit is a perfect pet</h1>
			<p>Rabbits have strikingly distinctive personalities. They can be as playful and silly as puppies or kittens, as independent and fascinating as cats, or as loyal and openly affectionate as dogs. And long-time rabbit owners claim that domestic rabbits are, in their own way, every bit as smart as cats and dogs. Dana Krempels, Ph.D., an evolutionary biologist at the University of Miami, sees daily examples of this in her group of 16 rabbits. &quot; Their intelligence is very different from other species &quot; she says, &quot; but is just as adaptive and just as elegant. &quot; Rabbits can easily learn to respond to their names, as well as to simple words, and they learn to use litterboxes readily. They are adroit at getting over, under, around or through barriers intended to restrict them, and some owners seem almost proud of their rabbits&apos; ability to negotiate household obstacles.</p>

			<h2>Warning!!!</h2>
			<p>You will need to provide your rabbit with suitable chewing toys and constructive ways to burn off energy. My rabbit have biten off three of my Nintendo Switch power line, one Macbook power line and one Razer mouse wire.</p>
