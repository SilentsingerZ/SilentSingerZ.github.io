# Team 4 Project
<h2>Information about your visualizations and what they show. Include information about interactions as appropriate.</h2>

<h2>Your design process (e.g., how did you go about designing, building, and refining your system? Why did you choose these representations?)</h2>

<h2>Team roles for each individual:</h2>

Tianlun Zhao:

Yi Man: Â I clean the "major.csv" data and create a visualization connent with this data. I use d3 to create the viusaliazation,
so the debug part is the hardest part for me. There is still a problem that I did not figure out. I want to create a function
which can help users to sort the data such as if you click a button, the data will sort from smallest to largest. I am still
working on this one.
